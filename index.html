        <h3 class="article-subtitle">Global annual electricity consumption is approximately 23,398 billion kilowatt hours. This is the story of what powers our world.</h3>

            <h3 class="collection-title">Introduction</h3>
            <p class="bodytext">Electricity is one of the most powerful forces in our lives. The fundamental principles of electricity generation were discovered during the 1820's by Michael Faraday. Since then the use of electricity to power appliances and technology has become ubiquitous. Electricity is used for heating, cooling, refrigiration, appliances, computers, electronics, machinery, manufacturing and public transportation systems among many others. The generation of sufficient amounts of electricity is therefore, of national and global concern.  </p>
            <p class="bodytext">Over the past century, the <strong>main energy sources for generating electricity have been fossil fuels, hydroelectricity, and nuclear energy</strong>. Over the last few decades, the strong growth of renewable sources have shifted attention to the concern of pollution which arises as a result of electricity generation. Despite concern over carbon dioxide emissions due to electricity consumption and generation, fossil fuels continue to remain dominant. <strong>In 2019, fossil fuels generated 64.5% of the worldwide electricity.</strong></p>
            <p class="bodytext">The following visualisation explores elextricity in a global context for the year 2019.</p>

                    <h3 class="quote_text"> “Present annual world consumption is about equal to the annihilation energy of 4 tons of matter” - Barney Oliver</h3>
                    <p class="bodytext"><strong>Fossil fuels include coal, petroleum, natural gas, oil shales, bitumens, tar sands and heavy oils.</strong> Fossil fuel power plants, burn fossil fuel materials in order to create heat which is in turns used to generate steam which drives turbines generating electricity.
                        When fossil fuels are burned, they release large amounts of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, into the air. Greenhouse gases trap radiating heat into the atmosphere and overtime cause the temperature of the earth to rise.
                        The adjacent choropleth map indicates the global use electricity sourced from fossil fuels.

            <p class="finaltext">Globaly, fossil fuel contributes to over <strong>60% of global electricity generation</strong>. This number has significantly dropped from the beginning of the century by around 20%. According to some sources, it is estimated that <strong> oil reserves will run out in 47 years, natural gas in 52 years and coal in 133 years.</strong></p>

                    <p class="bodytext">Hydroelectricity is electrical energy generated when falling water from reservoirs or flowing water from rivers, streams or waterfalls (run of river) is channelled through water turbines.Hydropower is the most widely used renewable energy source. It pairs well with other renweable sources and is a renewable energy source. 
                        Hydropower is expensive to run upfornt and cannot be implemented in areas where the geography is not favourable. Hydropower also presents some environmental impacts as the overwhelming majority of hydropower plants require the building of a dam. This construction often changes the surrounding environment significantly.

        <p class="finaltext">Hydropower is clean and renewable and certain designs are able to meet peak demand. It relies heavily on local hydrology and geography and is not always a viable implementation. According to some sources, it is estimated that <strong> hydropower can reduce cummulative greenhouse gas emissions by 5.6 gigatonnes.</strong></p>

                <h3 class="quote_text">"All the waste in a year from a nuclear power plant can be stored under a desk." - Ronald Reagan</h3>
                <p class="bodytext">Although public perception of nuclear power may be poor, nuclear power remains the most eco-friendly way to generate electricity. Nuclear power is generated through the process of fission, where uranium atoms are split and the resultant energy released is used to create steam which in turn spins a turbine.
                    Nuclear energy produces minimal waste. One 1-inch tall uranium pellet replaces 17,000 feet of natural gas, 120 gallons of oil and 1 ton of coal. Unlike other clean air energy sources such as solar, the land footprint for nuclear power plants is small.

        <p class="finaltext">Nuclear power plants <strong>do not emit precursors to acid rain, nor gases which contribute to global warming</strong> such as carbon dioxide. Despite all the benefits of nuclear power,<strong> it only provides about 10% of the world's electricity needs</strong> from about 445 power reactors.</p>
