              <p class="bodytext; column" style="width: 30%; text-align: center; font-family: 'Century Gothic'; font-size: 18px;">Electricity is one of the most powerful forces in our lives. The fundamental principles of electricity generation were discovered during the 1820's by Michael Faraday. Since then, the use of electricity to power appliances and technology has become ubiquitous. Electricity is used for heating, cooling, refrigiration, appliances, computers, electronics, machinery, manufacturing and public transportation systems among many others.</p>
              <p class="bodytext; column" style="width: 30%; text-align: center; font-family: 'Century Gothic';font-size: 18px;">Over the past century, the <strong>main energy sources for generating electricity have been fossil fuels.</strong>. Over the last few decades, the strong growth of renewable sources have shifted attention to the concern of pollution which arises as a result of electricity generation. Despite concern over carbon dioxide emissions due to electricity consumption and generation, fossil fuels continue to remain dominant.</p>
              <p class="bodytext; column" style="width: 30%; text-align: center; font-family: 'Century Gothic';font-size: 18px;"> <strong>In 2019, fossil fuels generated 64.5% of the worldwide electricity.</strong>What are the consequences of our electricity generation? To what degree do our methods harm the environment? And what are the drivers behind the methods we employ to source our energy. The following visualisation explores elextricity in a global context for the year 2019.</p>

                    <h3 class="quote_text"> “If we keep pulling death from the ground, we will reap death from the skies.” - Van Jones</h3>
                    <p class="bodytext"><strong>Fossil fuels include coal, petroleum, natural gas, oil shales, bitumens, tar sands and heavy oils.</strong> Fossil fuel power plants, burn fossil fuel materials in order to create heat which is in turns used to generate steam which drives turbines generating electricity.</p>
                        <p class="bodytext">When fossil fuels are burned, they release large amounts of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, into the air. Greenhouse gases trap radiating heat into the atmosphere and overtime cause the temperature of the earth to rise.
                        The adjacent choropleth map indicates the global use electricity sourced from fossil fuels.</p>
                        <p class="bodytext"> <strong>Notably, North Africa, the Middle East and much of Eastern Africa rely heavily on the use of fossil fuels for energy generation.</strong> </p>

            <p class="finaltext">Globaly, fossil fuel contributes to over <strong>60% of global electricity generation</strong>. This number has significantly dropped from the beginning of the century by around 20%. According to some sources, it is estimated that <strong> oil reserves will run out in 47 years, natural gas in 52 years and coal in 133 years.</strong></p>

Although Saudi Arabia's source of electricity generation is exclusively fossil fuel, it has been ranked 6th in the world for its solar energy potential and in 2012 pledged to receive a third of its energy demands from solar power by 2032.It has also announced investment in 17 nuclear power plants within the next 20 years.</p>
      <p class="bodytext; column" style="width: 30%; text-align: center; font-family: 'Century Gothic'"></strong>Industrial production refers to the output of industrial establishments and covers sectors such as mining, manufacturing, utilities and construction. <strong>In 2019, over 6,500 Million Metric Tons of CO2 were emmitted from industrial process in the US alone.</strong> Interestingly, although Saudi Arabia and Russia are the largest contributors to CO2 emissions they cannot attribute this to industrial processes. Canada - although a large contributor to CO2 emissions relies more on Hydroelectric power than fossil fuels as a source of energy and has the second highest production rate.  </p>
      <p class="bodytext; column" style="width: 30%; text-align: center; font-family: 'Century Gothic'"><strong>China contributes over a third of all CO2 emmissions globally.</strong>The remaining 7 countries collectively contribute a second third. China's overwhelming level of emissions can be attributed to it's construction-related activities which are among the main sources of CO2 emissions. China's extraordinary urbanization boom has intesified these activities. The production of cement and steel, which have undergirded China's infrastructure development, both emit a large amount of CO2 during the refining process.</p>

    <p class="finaltext">It seems that industrial processes are not a driver for high emissions amongst the top 8 countries which produce emissions as a number of countries with high emissions have negative industrial growth. <strong> The top 8 countries with the highest emissions contribute roughly two thirds of total global emissions, with China contributing a third on its own.</strong> A further exploration could consider to what degree the day to day habits of citizens affects emissions.</p>

<h3 class="collection-title" style="color: #092215; padding-left: 20px;">Conclusion</h3>
<div class="column-list"> 
  <p class="bodytext; column" style="width: 30%; text-align: center; font-family: 'Century Gothic'; font-size: 18px;">Generating electricity is a global concern as it is one of the most fundamental human necessities. The roots of energy generation are predominantly fossil fuel based and electricity genertion has therefore, contributed significantly to the emission of CO2 and the current climate emergency. <strong>Globally, most countries rely primarily on fossil fuels for their energy demands.</strong> Global emission trends, however, do not mirror global usage of fossil fuels as a source.</p>
  <p class="bodytext; column" style="width: 30%; text-align: center; font-family: 'Century Gothic'; font-size: 18px;">Despite the global prevalence of fossil fuels as a source, the link between the wealth of a country and emissions is tenuous.<strong> There does not seem to be a a strong linnk between populaion, GDP and the tons of CO2 emissions per person.</strong> A number of countries with large populations and low GDP do not appear to rely on fossil fuels for electricity generation. Further exploration has revealed that the industry sector does not play a deciding role in the emissions of a country.</p>
  <p class="bodytext; column" style="width: 30%; text-align: center; font-family: 'Century Gothic'; font-size: 18px;"><strong>Interestingly, despite the expenses associated with implementing renewable energies, countries with relatively low GDPs such as Brazil, Ethiopia, Uganda, Malawi and Zambia rely in majority on renewable sources. This suggests that despite having more resources, countries with higher GDPs are not currently investing into renewable sources.</strong> With the exception of Canada, Norway and Sweden, countries with a high GDP must begin to invest in renewable sources, as they are often also countries with the highest emissions.</p>
