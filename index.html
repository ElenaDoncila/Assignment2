              <p class="bodytext; column" style="width: 30%; text-align: center; font-family: 'Century Gothic'; font-size: 18px;">Electricity is one of the most powerful forces in our lives. The fundamental principles of electricity generation were discovered during the 1820's by Michael Faraday. Since then, the use of electricity to power appliances and technology has become ubiquitous. Electricity is used for heating, cooling, refrigeration, appliances, computers, electronics, machinery, manufacturing and public transportation systems among many others.</p>
              <p class="bodytext; column" style="width: 30%; text-align: center; font-family: 'Century Gothic';font-size: 18px;">Over the past century, the <strong>most common source for generating electricity has been fossil fuels.</strong> In the last few decades, the strong growth of renewable sources has shifted attention to the concern of pollution which arises as a result of electricity generation. Despite concern over carbon dioxide emissions due to electricity consumption and generation, fossil fuels continue to remain dominant.</p>
              <p class="bodytext; column" style="width: 30%; text-align: center; font-family: 'Century Gothic';font-size: 18px;"> <strong>In 2019, fossil fuels generated 64.5% of worldwide electricity. What are the consequences of our electricity generation? To what degree do our methods harm the environment? What are the drivers behind the methods we employ to source our energy?</strong> The following visualisation explores electricity in a global context for the year 2019.</p>

                    <h3 class="quote_text"> “If we keep pulling death from the ground, we will reap death from the skies.” - Van Jones</h3>
                    <p class="bodytext"><strong>Fossil fuels include coal, petroleum, natural gas, oil shales, bitumens, tar sands and heavy oils.</strong> Fossil fuel power plants burn fossil fuel materials in order to create heat which is in turn used to generate steam which drives turbines generating electricity.</p>
                        <p class="bodytext">When fossil fuels are burned, they release large amounts of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, into the air. Greenhouse gases trap radiating heat into the atmosphere and over time cause the temperature of the earth to rise.
                        The adjacent choropleth map indicates the global use electricity sourced from fossil fuels.</p>
                        <p class="bodytext"> <strong>Notably, North Africa, the Middle East and much of Eastern Asia rely heavily on the use of fossil fuels for energy generation.</strong> </p>

Although Saudi Arabia's source of electricity generation is exclusively fossil fuel, it has been ranked 6th in the world for its solar energy potential and in 2012 pledged to meet a third of its energy demands from solar power by 2032. It has also announced investment in 17 nuclear power plants within the next 20 years.</p>
      <p class="bodytext; column" style="width: 33%; text-align: center; font-family: 'Century Gothic';padding: 10px;"></strong>Industrial production refers to the output of industrial establishments and covers sectors such as mining, manufacturing, utilities and construction and is represented here as a percent for the year of 2019 (growth or decrease from 2018.). <strong>In 2019, over 6,500 Million Metric Tons of CO2 were emitted from industrial processes in the US alone.</strong> Interestingly, although Saudi Arabia and Russia are the largest contributors to CO2 emissions they cannot attribute this to industrial processes. Canada - although a large contributor to CO2 emissions relies more on Hydroelectric power than fossil fuels as a source of energy and has the second highest production rate.  </p>
      <p class="bodytext; column" style="width: 33%; text-align: center; font-family: 'Century Gothic';padding: 10px;"><strong>China contributes over a third of all CO2 emissions globally.</strong>The remaining 7 countries collectively contribute a second third. China's overwhelming level of emissions can be attributed to its construction-related activities which are among the main sources of CO2 emissions. China's extraordinary urbanization boom has intensified these activities. The production of cement and steel, which have underpinned China's infrastructure development, both emit a large amount of CO2 during the refining process.</p>

    <p class="finaltext">It seems that industrial processes are not a driver for high emissions amongst the top 8 countries which produce emissions as a number of countries with high emissions have negative industrial growth. <strong> The top 8 countries with the highest emissions contribute roughly two thirds of total global emissions, with China contributing a third on its own.</strong> A further exploration could consider to what degree the day to day habits of citizens affects emissions.</p>

<h3 class="collection-title" style="color: #092215; padding-left: 20px;">Conclusion</h3>
<div class="column-list"> 
  <p class="bodytext; column" style="width: 30%; text-align: center; font-family: 'Century Gothic'; font-size: 18px;">Generating electricity is a global concern as it is one of the most fundamental human necessities. The roots of energy generation are predominantly fossil fuel based and electricity generation has therefore, contributed significantly to the emission of CO2 and the current climate emergency. <strong>Globally, most countries rely primarily on fossil fuels for their energy demands.</strong> Global emission trends, however, do not mirror global usage of fossil fuels as a source.</p>
  <p class="bodytext; column" style="width: 30%; text-align: center; font-family: 'Century Gothic'; font-size: 18px;">Despite the global prevalence of fossil fuels as a source, the link between the wealth of a country and emissions is tenuous.<strong> There does seems to be a strong link between GDP and the tons of CO2 emissions per person.</strong> A number of countries with large populations and low GDP do not appear to rely on fossil fuels for electricity generation. Further exploration has revealed that the industry sector does not play a deciding role in the emissions of a country.</p>
  <p class="bodytext; column" style="width: 30%; text-align: center; font-family: 'Century Gothic'; font-size: 18px;"><strong>Interestingly, despite the expenses associated with implementing renewable energies, countries with relatively low GDPs such as Brazil, Ethiopia, Uganda, Malawi and Zambia rely in majority on renewable sources. This suggests that despite having more resources, countries with higher GDPs are not currently investing into renewable sources.</strong> With the exception of Canada, Norway and Sweden, countries with a high GDP must begin to invest in renewable sources, as they are often also countries with the highest emissions.</p>
