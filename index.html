        <h3 class="article-subtitle">Global annual electricity consumption is approximately 23,398 billion kilowatt hours. This is the story of what powers our world.</h3>

            <h3 class="collection-title">Introduction</h3>
            <p class="bodytext">Electricity is one of the most powerful forces in our lives. The fundamental principles of electricity generation were discovered during the 1820's by Michael Faraday. Since then the use of electricity to power appliances and technology has become ubiquitous. Electricity is used for heating, cooling, refrigiration, appliances, computers, electronics, machinery, manufacturing and public transportation systems among many others. The generation of sufficient amounts of electricity is therefore, of national and global concern.  </p>
            <p class="bodytext">Over the past century, the <strong>main energy sources for generating electricity have been fossil fuels, hydroelectricity, and nuclear energy</strong>. Over the last few decades, the strong growth of renewable sources have shifted attention to the concern of pollution which arises as a result of electricity generation. Despite concern over carbon dioxide emissions due to electricity consumption and generation, fossil fuels continue to remain dominant. <strong>In 2019, fossil fuels generated 64.5% of the worldwide electricity.</strong></p>
            <p class="bodytext">The following visualisation explores elextricity in a global context for the year 2019.</p>

                    <h3 class="quote_text"> “Present annual world consumption is about equal to the annihilation energy of 4 tons of matter” - Barney Oliver</h3>
                    <p class="bodytext"><strong>Fossil fuels include coal, petroleum, natural gas, oil shales, bitumens, tar sands and heavy oils.</strong> Fossil fuel power plants, burn fossil fuel materials in order to create heat which is in turns used to generate steam which drives turbines generating electricity.
                        When fossil fuels are burned, they release large amounts of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, into the air. Greenhouse gases trap radiating heat into the atmosphere and overtime cause the temperature of the earth to rise.
                        The adjacent choropleth map indicates the global use electricity sourced from fossil fuels.

            <p class="finaltext">Globaly, fossil fuel contributes to over <strong>60% of global electricity generation</strong>. This number has significantly dropped from the beginning of the century by around 20%. According to some sources, it is estimated that <strong> oil reserves will run out in 47 years, natural gas in 52 years and coal in 133 years.</strong></p>
