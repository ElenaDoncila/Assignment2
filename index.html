            <div class="column-list"> 
              <p class="bodytext; column" style="width: 30%; text-align: center;">Electricity is one of the most powerful forces in our lives. The fundamental principles of electricity generation were discovered during the 1820's by Michael Faraday. Since then the use of electricity to power appliances and technology has become ubiquitous. Electricity is used for heating, cooling, refrigiration, appliances, computers, electronics, machinery, manufacturing and public transportation systems among many others.</p>
              <p class="bodytext; column" style="width: 30%; text-align: center;">Over the past century, the <strong>main energy sources for generating electricity have been fossil fuels, hydroelectricity, and nuclear energy</strong>. Over the last few decades, the strong growth of renewable sources have shifted attention to the concern of pollution which arises as a result of electricity generation. Despite concern over carbon dioxide emissions due to electricity consumption and generation, fossil fuels continue to remain dominant. <strong>In 2019, fossil fuels generated 64.5% of the worldwide electricity.</strong></p>
              <p class="bodytext; column" style="width: 30%; text-align: center;">What are the consequences of our electricity generation? To what degree do our methods harm the environment? And what are the drivers behind the methods we employ to source our energy. The following visualisation explores elextricity in a global context for the year 2019.</p>

                  <h3 class="collection-title" style=" padding-top: 0%; color: #092215;">Fossil Fuels</h3>
                    <h3 class="quote_text"> “If we keep pulling death from the ground, we will reap death from the skies.” - Van Jones</h3>
                    <p class="bodytext"><strong>Fossil fuels include coal, petroleum, natural gas, oil shales, bitumens, tar sands and heavy oils.</strong> Fossil fuel power plants, burn fossil fuel materials in order to create heat which is in turns used to generate steam which drives turbines generating electricity.</p>
                        <p class="bodytext">When fossil fuels are burned, they release large amounts of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, into the air. Greenhouse gases trap radiating heat into the atmosphere and overtime cause the temperature of the earth to rise.
                        The adjacent choropleth map indicates the global use electricity sourced from fossil fuels.</p>
                        <p class="bodytext"> <strong>Notably, North Africa, the Middle East and much of Eastern Africa rely heavily on the use of fossil fuels for energy generation.</strong> </p>

            <p class="finaltext">Globaly, fossil fuel contributes to over <strong>60% of global electricity generation</strong>. This number has significantly dropped from the beginning of the century by around 20%. According to some sources, it is estimated that <strong> oil reserves will run out in 47 years, natural gas in 52 years and coal in 133 years.</strong></p>

                <p class="bodytext"> According to the World Resources Insisitute, globally, the primary source of greenhouse gas emissions is the generation of electricity. <strong>Energy production of all types accounts for 72% of all emissions.</strong> </p>
                <p class="bodytext">Interestingly, although Northern Africa, Eastern Asia and the Middle East rely most on fossil fuels, with the exception of Saudi Arabia, Omand and the UAE, the largest CO2 emissions are Australia, Canada, Russia, Germany, the US, Japan and Greenland.</p>
                <p class="bodytext">Countries such as India and China, the most populated regions in the world do not produce the largest amount of CO2 emissions per person.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="bodytext" style="text-align: left; font-size: 13px;">* Data is not available for countries in grey.</p>
        <p class="finaltext"> <strong>The choropleth map indicates that although some regions of the world rely most on fossil fuels for their energy production, they are not as likely to also have the highest rates of CO2 emissions.</strong> What are the drivers of high rates of CO2 emissions around the world? Is there a relationship between the overall wealth of a country and it's emissions?</p>

                <p class="bodytext">Interestingly, there seems to be an upward trend between the GDP of a country and the relative amount of CO2 per person emmited. <strong>Despite potential expectations, population does not seem to be a big driver of emissions as the most populated countries such as India and China are not prominent features.</strong></p>

        </div>
        <p class="finaltext">It appears that there is not a strong relationship between population and the tonnes of CO2 emissions per person. <strong>Countries with a high GDP appear to also have the high rates of CO2 emissions per person.</strong> Qatar and Singapore have the highest rates of emissions and are also some of the highest GDPs but have comparably small populations. What are the features of top contributors to CO2 emissions?</p>
